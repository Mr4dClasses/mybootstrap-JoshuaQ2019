   <p>The western world we live in today, makes every other time in history.</p>
The western world today is at its greatest height with it being the global strongarm of technology and weapons. We have also been able to make contact with counries that have remained in isolation for centuries, and with those conections it helped develope new forms of technology as well as give us an advantage over amny other countires in topics such as medicine or mathematics. In oredr to understand the roots of this newfound knowledge and the rise of the west, lets go back to the civilization that founded it.<br>

      <P> The Greece wasn't actually actually founded til 800 B.C, which for reference Egypts decline was around 1100 B.C. Meaning unfortuanately alot of the buildings such as the parthenon were nowhere near as old as The pyramids, or Luxor. The civilization that predated Ancient greece and was preasent during ancient egypt was Mycanean Greece. My canean Greece was an advanced trading civilization That produced some of the finest works of jewelery, art, and architecture inthe bronze age. Even though the Mycanean civilization was by indead stable fthrough its long histoty pf govenring significant parts of Greece, like all the other civilizations during the bronze age collapse it would too fall, leading the way for tales like the illiad and the odessy to define the culture of ancient Greece we know today and to practically revived a country that had been destroyed with the Mycaneans that inhabited it.

      <h3>Column 3
      <p> I dont think it even needs to be said as to why ancient Greece was "radical, Dude!" For one the architecture and art of Ancient greece blend styles of Egypt, the Assyrian Empire, as well as use their own passion and creativity to create beautiful statues that forms the basis of styles such as gothic or Renissance, and Roman architecture as even today it can pose a significant challenge to distinguish Roman statues and greek ones. Second of all, Greece would come to invent one of the best forms of governance in history. That being Democracy of cource. The democracy The athenians were living under wasn't as tolerant as the modern version as in Athens women weren't even allowed to own property, in sharp contrast to their rival in the Peloponese; Sparta. Spartan women were allowed to own property and get the best education had to offer,on top of that just like the men Spartan women went through brutal training at a young age. Though the Democcracy the Athenians had founded would set up the Democracy we practise current;ly, just like greek art that would lead to the creation of beautiful stone statues created by artists such as michael angelo, and just like the rights women enjoyed would start a gradual journey to give women most of the rights men receive.
